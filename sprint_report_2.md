## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The team worked hard this sprint to finish much of the essential user-facing features. Having wrapped up the bus display, route display, and associated buttons and toggles, we can begin to focus on quality of life specific updates in sprint 3. This sprint was difficult as it focused primarily on socket-based function. Between the socket-based work and the data parsing necessary to gather stop data, additional files were necessary that took care of said functions. All in all, despite these features being a moderate amount of work, the added data and socket work created a hefty workload for the team to manage. Meetings this sprint were productive, and the team did a good job of keeping open communication on the status of their work. Overall, this sprint went pretty smoothly, and next sprint should benefit as a result.

## Unfinished Work
