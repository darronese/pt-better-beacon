## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
NOTE by Genevieve: we will do this when the sprint is over.

Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't
repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand
how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any
significant learnings for your team.
## Unfinished Work
NOTE by Genevieve: we will probably have a lot to put here since we have 20+ issues and all of our project issues were added to this first sprint. Do
this after the inital sprint 1.

If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user
stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward
completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of
acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the
issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate
it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so
that it can be addressed later.
